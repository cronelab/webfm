# Electrode marker

- These scripts were created by Yujing Wang circa ~2016

- Matlab interface to load in a brain image (.jpg screenshot exposing entire brain with white electrode markers on it) and an array of electrode names.
- Start the GUI, load the two files, click the electrodes.
- This will export 2? csv files. One is for CCEPS, the other for WebFM.

## To do:
- Make CCEPS and WebFM use the same electrode location files. C'mon.
- Use the matlab code to create a node/python app that can be run via WebFM client side
- Automate electrode naming process?
 - Probably not gonna happen.
